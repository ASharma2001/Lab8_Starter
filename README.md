# Lab 8 - Starter
Question 1) I would have automated tests whenever code is pushed. This way, everytime someone makes a commit to the branch,
the code can be tested every time. Ideally, I would have tests ran for each of the following scenarios, but to pick one I would 
select the first one. 

Question 2) No

Question 3) No, I would use end to end testing as this is a process and not a single function call. You want to test that the message sends, renders for the other users and the user
who sent the message.

Question 4) Yes. This is testing a a specific feature of a message. The specific feature is no message can be longer than 80 characters, so it is easy to test with unit testing
